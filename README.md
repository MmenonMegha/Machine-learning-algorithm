# Supervised Machine-learning-algorithm : Classification techniques
Supervised learning is a process of providing input data as well as correct output data to the machine learning model. The aim of a supervised learning algorithm is to find a mapping function to map the input variable(x) with the output variable(y).
In the real-world, supervised learning can be used for Risk Assessment, Image classification, Fraud Detection, spam filtering, etc.

 ## Classification Algorithms:

Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.

- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support vector Machines (SVM)
